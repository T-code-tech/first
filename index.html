    <h2>History</h2>
       <p> Having started out as a small fishing village, Shanghai became an important treaty port after the First Opium War and was quickly opened to foreign influence. The city was soon divided into concessions independently administered by the Americans, British, French, etc. Even though there were specifically Chinese residential areas, a lot of people chose to settle in foreign neighbourhoods resulting in a mix of cultures and traditions that has formed Shanghai's signature character. The city became the centre of commercial and cultural activity in the country and attracted both foreign investment and migrants from other parts of China.
        
        Today, Shanghai is a colourful blend of glass skyscrapers housing offices of international enterprises and quaint little neighbourhoods with authentic tea shops and flea markets.</p>
