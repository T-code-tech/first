            <h3>Let's talk about the life of the city</h3>

  <div class="text-box">
  <p>Shanghai is one of China's leading cities when it comes to career opportunities. <br>Money and money making are important aspects of the city culture. The use of cash is getting to be very rare. <br> The city is alive 24/7 and you will be able to order takeout and even get a haircut at any time of the day and night. <br> The rapid pace of life is a trait shared by most big cities, but Shanghai is notoriously fast.

You will see people on streets starting from early as four oçlock in the morning and  <br> the hustle doesn't quite down until late in the night. People in this city talk about money a lot and you should expect questions relating to your salary, rent, expenses etc. which are not considered rude <br> The stark contrast of posh high rises and small traditional lane houses is exaggerated even further by the striking contrast of <br> luxury high rises with tradional lane homes.
